# pipe-rename

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/pipe-rename)](https://crates.io/crates/pipe-rename)

`pipe-rename` takes a list of files as input, opens your `$EDITOR` of choice, then
renames those files accordingly.

## Installation

`cargo install pipe-rename`

This will install the `renamer` binary.

## Usage

Usage is simple, just pipe a list of files into `renamer`. This will open your
`$EDITOR` (or vim, if not set or passed with `--editor`), and once your editor
exits it will detect which files were renamed:

```bash
ls | renamer
```

You can also supply filenames as positional arguments. To rename `.txt` files
in the current directory:

```bash
renamer *.txt
```

The default behavior is to rename files, but you can override this. If you want
to run `git mv old new` on each rename, you can do something like this:

```bash
ls | renamer --rename-command "git mv"
```

## Helptext

```
Takes a list of files and renames/moves them by piping them through an external editor

USAGE:
    renamer [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

ARGS:
    <FILES>...


OPTIONS:
    -c, --rename-command <COMMAND>
            Optionally set a custom rename command, like 'git mv'

    -e, --editor <EDITOR>
            Optionally set an editor, overriding EDITOR environment variable and default

    -f, --force
            Overwrite existing files

    -h, --help
            Print help information

    -n, --filenames-only
            Only rename filenames

    -p, --pretty-diff
            Prettify diffs

    -u, --undo
            Undo the previous renaming operation

    -V, --version
            Print version information

    -y, --yes
            Answer all prompts with yes
```

### Caveat emptor

**NB:** it makes sense to be aware of the issues `ls` can cause in this
context, depending on the `ls` flavor (or substitute, such as `lsd`, `exa`
...) used. Please read [this document](https://web.archive.org/web/20230102124738/http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs)
for more information.

While your shell will pass the file names individually, no matter if they
contain whitespace, an `ls` that fails to detect the pipe and print one file
name per line will cause issues. Unfortunately `ls -Q` also isn't a solution
here, because unlike the shell -- which will strip quotes prior to passing
them to invoked commands -- `renamer` won't handle the quoted names and will
probably complain about non-existent files, too.

### Advanced usage

If you have tools like GNU `find` at your disposal, you can also use the
following method:

```bash
find -type f -exec renamer {} +
```

This would execute `renamer` with all of the files matched by `find`. You can
use additional `find` predicates such as `-name` or `-ipath` to limit which
files to rename. There is, however, one caveat: on large lists of files you
may encounter multiple invocations of `renamer` -- and thus your editor -- due
to how `find ... -exec {} +` works. It will pass as many file names on the
command line as it can fit but it is limited by `ARG_MAX` (see `getconf ARG_MAX`
output for how long the overall command line length can be on your system).

Other `find` flavors would allow the following, but it would invoke `renamer`
-- and thus your editor -- *once for every single found file*:

```bash
find -type f -exec renamer {} \;
```

In order to sidestep this issue, you can employ `xargs` in conjunction with
`find` like so (`-print` is implied for `find`):

```
find -type f | xargs renamer --editor vim
```

The part past `xargs` is the invocation of `renamer` without the file names.
It exists just to demonstrate how you would pass arguments to `renamer` using
this method.

If your files contain wonky characters you could also try:

```
find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 renamer --editor vim
```

Alas, this could be asking for trouble. If your file names contain line breaks,
for example, this could confuse `renamer` which expects a single file name per
line when re-reading the edited file.
